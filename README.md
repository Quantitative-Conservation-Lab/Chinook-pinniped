# Chinook-pinniped

This repository contains code and data used in an analysis to estimate population-specific mortality of endangered Chinook salmon in the Lower Colmbia River associated with increased pinniped abundance. It is inteded to help reviewers (and eventually readers) understand the analysis. Two of the datasets have been altered so the results will not exactly match those in the draft manuscript, but the origin datasets will be uploaded when the paper is published.
